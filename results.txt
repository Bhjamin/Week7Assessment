It looks like the time to run each method depends on the size of your array.
When you have an array with a length of around 1000 or more then it is more 
efficient to use the push method. If your array is less than 1000 items then the 
unshift method becomes for time efficient. From the first couple results I thought the 
push method would continue to beat the unshift method significantly. It is
interesting to see that in the two smallest arrays, their times are close with
the unshift method barely beating out the push method.
